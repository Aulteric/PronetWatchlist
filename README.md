# PronetWatchlist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.11. Inside have been used Ngrx for store management, bootstrap and mobile first design(as per requirements). I tried to use as much things as I can so I can show my capabilities. The Api used for this project is provided from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and i made a website showing the latest movies/tv-series.
